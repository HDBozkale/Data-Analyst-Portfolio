# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis Portfolio Project

## **Project Overview**

This project is a comprehensive **Data Analysis Portfolio** focusing on a year's worth of pizza sales data from a fictional pizzeria. The goal of this analysis was to transform raw sales data into actionable business intelligence by calculating key performance indicators (KPIs), identifying sales trends, and determining the best and worst-selling products.

The analysis demonstrates proficiency in **SQL** for data extraction and manipulation, and the use of visualization tools (implied through the included CSV outputs) for impactful storytelling. This repository includes the original dataset, all SQL queries used for analysis, and the resulting KPI and trend data.

## **📈 Key Findings & Insights**

The analysis yielded the following key business insights:

* **Total Revenue:** **$817,860.05** (A strong baseline for a year of operations.)
* **Customer Behavior:** The **Average Order Value** is approximately **$38.31**, suggesting customers typically buy more than one item per order (supported by the **Average Pizza Per Order** of **2.32**).
* **Busiest Day/Time:** **Fridays** have the highest order volume (**3,538 orders**), and the peak ordering hours are consistently around **12:00 PM** and **5:00 PM** (lunch and dinner rushes), indicating needs for focused staffing during these times.
* **Popular Categories:** **Classic** and **Supreme** pizza categories drive the majority of sales revenue.
* **Sizing Preference:** **Large** pizzas account for a significant portion of total revenue (**~45.9%**).
* **Top Sellers (Volume):** The **Classic Deluxe Pizza** and **The Hawaiian Pizza** are the most popular items.
* **Opportunities for Improvement:** The **Brie Carre Pizza** is the lowest-volume seller, suggesting a potential candidate for removal from the menu or a promotional strategy change.
