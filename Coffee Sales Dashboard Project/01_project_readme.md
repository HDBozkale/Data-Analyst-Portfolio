Coffee Sales Excel Dashboard — Project Overview

This dashboard provides a clear, interactive view of key performance metrics for a fictional coffee sales dataset. It was built in Excel using pivot tables, lookup functions, and dynamic charts to demonstrate practical data-analysis and dashboard-design skills.

The dashboard brings together insights from multiple data tables — orders, customers, and products — and summarizes them into an easy-to-read business view. Core components include:

Total Sales Overview: A high-level summary of total revenue generated across all coffee products.

Sales by Country: A bar chart visualizing revenue by geographic market to highlight where demand is strongest.

Top 5 Customers: A ranked view of the highest-value customers, showcasing the ability to perform customer-level analysis.

Product-Level Insights: Visibility into which coffee products contribute most to sales.

This project showcases my ability to clean and structure datasets, build pivot-based reporting, and design dashboards that communicate insights clearly for business decision-making.[Coffee Sales Dashboard.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24104992/Coffee.Sales.Dashboard.xlsx)
